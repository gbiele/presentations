## Reproducible research in a context {background-image="pngs/Badges.jpg" background-size="110%" background-opacity="0.075"}

**Providing a reproducible analysis is the most important and easiest aspect of open science**

-   data cannot always be easily shared
-   analysis connects data and results
-   confirming pre-registered hypotheses is less valuable without it
-   pre-registration is often not possible or useful [^1]

[^1]: Works well with standardized experiments, less so well with observational data. As an alternative to pre-registration, one can develop the analysis plan on a subset of the data.

## Why reproducible research?

-   builds trust
-   reduces errors
-   makes it easier to write the method section [^2]
-   streamlines manuscript writing

[^2]: If there is code, one does not need to mention every inconsequential detail in the methods section.

## Levels of reproducible data analysis

1.  Script all analysis steps
2.  Version control software & public repositories for publication
3.  Scientific and technical publishing system for documenting and implementing analysis pipeline
4.  Scientific and technical publishing system for writing papers

## Tools for reproducible data analysis

-   ![](pngs/R_logo.png){height="0.75in"} [or another programming language]{style="color: #E1E4EC;"}
-   ![](pngs/RStudio-Logo-Flat.png){height="0.75in"} [or other IDEs with git/github integration]{style="color: #E1E4EC;"}
-   ![](pngs/Git-Logo.png){height="0.75in"} ![](pngs/GitHub-logo-768x432.png){height="1in"} [or other version control software]{style="color: #E1E4EC;"}
-   ![](pngs/quarto.jpg){height="0.75in" layout-valign="bottom"} ![](pngs/rmarkdown.png){height="1in"} [or other]{style="color: #E1E4EC;"}

## Scripting {background-image="pngs/R_logo.png" background-opacity="0.15"}

**Different scripts for different steps** [(Example)](https://github.com/gbiele/SPS358/tree/master/est_effect)

-   utility functions[^3]
-   data cleaning and preparation[^4]
-   running analyses [^5]
-   preparing analysis results for the manuscript

[^3]: Using functions to implement analysis steps makes the scripts more readable

[^4]: If possible: Make packages that support common tasks in the lab, but don't underestimate how hard this is to do!

[^5]: Use packages like `MplusAutomation` to interface with external software.

## Working around slow analysis parts

<br>

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

fn = "my_analysis_results.Rdata"

if (file.exists(fn)) {
  load(fn)
} else {
  # make my analysis
  save(my_fit, file = fn)
}

```

## Version control {background-image="pngs/Git-Logo.png" background-size="110%" background-opacity="0.075"}

**Start each paper by setting up a (git/github) project**

-   easily allows to go back to older versions of analyses
-   saves as backup method [^6]
-   **allows to work jointly on a project**
-   ![](pngs/RStudio-Logo-Flat.png){height="0.5in"} is well integrated with git/github [(show)](https://github.com/gbiele){.external target="_blank"}
-   first step to later publishing the code
-   **Hard: Sufficient & continuous code documentation**

[^6]: Can be especially useful on TSD

## Document analysis pipeline in R Markdown {background-image="pngs/Science.png" background-size="65%" background-opacity="0.5" background-position="right"}

-   R Markdown [document](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/VirologyCharite/SARS-CoV-2-VL-paper/blob/main/ExtendedMethods.html)[^7] for
    -   data cleaning
    -   statistical analysis
    -   supplementary <br> analyses & results
    -   generation of <br> statistics for paper

## Writing papers in RStudio with papaja {background-image="pngs/papaja.png" background-size="65%" background-opacity="0.1"}

on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/papaja/index.html) &  [github](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) 

- is an R Markdown-based package to write APA-6 compliant papers
- GUI to search references (based on bibtex files)
- allows automatic references to figures & tables in the supplement
- APA styles for tables and figures
- Outputs MS Word or PDF files
- **Upfront investment, but provides comes with huge benefits!**

Why reproducible analysis?

- makes good research easier
  - less errors
  - faster manuscripts
  - reviewers appreciate [^7]
- reliability & trust
- lead by example

Why _not_ ?

- Start-up investment
- can't hide parts of the analysis
- You want to write as fast as possible a couple of papers to finally become a PI
